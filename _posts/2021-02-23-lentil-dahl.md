![Lentil Dahl](/images/lentil-dahl.jpg)

### Lentils 
300g red lentils (masoor dal)
150g chana dahl (split gram)
3 tsps turmeric 
2 tsps chili powder
2 Â½ tsps salt
2 litres water
Coriander to garnish (or stir in frozen curry leaves)
2 red dried chilies to garnish (optional)
Frozen curry leaves (optional)
 
### Tempering 
4 tbsp vegetable oil.
4 large onions (about 1.2 kg), chopped 
2 tsps cumin seeds 
6 garlic cloves, crushed or chopped
1 cm ginger, chopped
4 green chillies, seeded and chopped (optional)
4 teaspoons Kashmiri chili powder
4 tomatoes, coarsely chopped or a 400g can of chopped tomatoes
 
### Recipe 
* Mix lentil ingredients in a large pot cover and bring to boil on LF hob at HI heat. About 10 minutes.
* Simmer on medium heat with slightly ajar lid cover until most of the liquid is absorbed and the chana dahl is breaking down. Stir occasionally to avoid the dahl sticking to the bottom of the pot. Approximately 50 minutes.
* Melt oil in a frying pan. 
* Add cumin seeds and fry until they crackle. 
* Add garlic and continue frying, stirring occasionally until aroma of cooked garlic is evident. 
* Add the onion and continue frying on medium until it turns brown. 
* Stir in green chillies, ginger and chilli powder and continue frying for 1.5 minutes. 
* Stir in tomatoes. 
* Pour tempering over lentils and stir. 
* Mix in coriander leaves. Garish with a few dried red chilies.

# Bio for Satnam Singh

## Short
Satnam Singh is a Fellow at [Groq](http://groq.com) where he works on the design of chips to accelerate machine learning applications, as well as programming models for these chips. He has a specific focus on the application of functional programming languages for the design of domain specific accelerator chips and their programming models.

## Medium
Satnam Singh is a Fellow at [Groq](http://groq.com) where he works on the design of chips to accelerate machine learning applications, as well as programming models for these chips. He has a specific focus on the application of functional programming languages for the design of domain specific accelerator chips and their programming models.

His research interests include functional programming in Haskell, high level techniques for hardware design (Lava, Bluespec, DSLs in Haskell, Coq and C#), formal methods, FPGAs, and concurrent and parallel programming. He also has experience with cluster management and Android binary optimization.

Satnam Singh has previously worked at Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Xilinx and has also been an academic at the University of Glasgow and the University of Birmingham.

He also has experience with cluster management (e.g. configuration management, and he was an early dev on Kubernetes) and Android binary optimization.

Satnam Singh has previously worked at Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Xilinx and has also been an academic at the University of Glasgow and the University of Birmingham. He is a senior member of the ACM and IEEE and a past Fellow of the IET. He is also an elected member of IFIP WG2.8 (functional programming) and IFIP WG2.11 (program generation). He previously served as an elected member of ACM SIGPLAN. He has held part-time or honorary positions at Imperial College London, the University of Washington, and the University of Santa Cruz (UCSC).
